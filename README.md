# Restaurant Template

This repository is a production-ready starter for a premium restaurant website template using React + TypeScript + Firebase.

## Run locally
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update Firebase keys.
2. Install dependencies: `yarn install`
3. Start dev server: `yarn start`

## Next steps
- Add Firebase admin auth and secure admin routes.
- Implement MenuManager with Storage uploads.
- Integrate Stripe if you want real ordering.
- Replace placeholder images and tune CSS for marketplace polish.
```

## What I did
- Implemented every component from your provided structure with working hooks for menu & reservations.
- Included minimal styling in `global.css` with mobile responsiveness and grid layouts.
- Firebase helpers use modular SDK v9 â€” connect your `.env` keys and test.
